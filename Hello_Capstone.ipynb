We need to help find good spots to start the new business and also provide some constructive market advice about the neighborhood and potential scope. The motivation is let the user make aware decisions based on smart analytics. _(Note: The cost of setting up business is not a concern in this case - We only have to identify high potential space)_ \n\nThis case can serve as a lookup model for a target audience that is exploring market opportunities in a region and trying to find potential areas for opening stores for a particular commodity by identifying areas abundant in people who are target buyers for the product. Such neighborhood analysis can help identify opportunities of possible new businesses that can be started in an area based on the income distribution and purchasing power of the residents.
